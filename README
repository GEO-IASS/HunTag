Huntag - a sequential tagger for NLP using Maximum Entropy Learning and
Hidden Markov Models

Requirements: In order for Huntag to work, the Maximum Entropy toolkit must
be installed with Python bindings. It can be obtained from:

http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/lzhang10/maxent_toolkit.html

Based on training data, Huntag can perform any kind of sequential sentence
tagging and has been used for NP chunking and Named Entity Recognition.

Input data must be a tab-separated file with one word per line and an empty
line to mark sentence boundaries. Each line must contain the same number of
fields and the last field must contain the correct tag for the word, which
may be in the BI format used at CoNLL shared tasks (e. g. B-NP to mark the
first word of a noun phrase, I-NP to mark the rest and O to mark words
outside an NP) or in the so-called BIE1 format which has a seperate symbol
for words constituting a chunk themselves (1-NP) and one for the last words
of multi-word phrases (E-NP). The first two characters of answer tags
should always conform to one of these two conventions, the rest may be any
string describing the category. 

The flexibility of Huntag comes from the fact that it will generate any kind
of features from the input data given the appropriate python functions.
Several dozens of features used regularly in NLP tasks are already
implemented in the file features.py, however the user is encouraged to add
any number of her own.

Once the desired features are implemented, a data set and a configuration
file containing the list of feature functions to be used are all Huntag
needs to perform training and tagging.
